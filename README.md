# 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a **simple yet fun** Python-based game where the player competes against the computer in a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is fully interactive and runs in the command line.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The game will display your options:
   - `0` for 🪨 **Rock**
   - `1` for 📄 **Paper**
   - `2` for ✂️ **Scissors**
2. Enter your choice by typing `0`, `1`, or `2` when prompted.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The result will be displayed:
   - 🏳️ **It's a draw** if both choices are the same.
   - 🏆 **Player wins** if the player’s choice beats the computer’s choice.
   - ❌ **Player loses** if the computer’s choice beats the player’s choice.

## 📜 Rules
- 🪨 **Rock** beats ✂️ **Scissors**
- ✂️ **Scissors** beat 📄 **Paper**
- 📄 **Paper** beats 🪨 **Rock**
- If both the player and the computer make the same choice, it's a **draw**.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🔄 **Randomized computer choice** using Python's `random` module.
- 💻 **User input** to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
